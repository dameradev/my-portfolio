Client had hundreds of companies that make weekly orders from them. They are a major dog gear vendor based in Norway. My job was to create a platform which will make an easy to use interface for their customers (businesses) to make orders`, `They also needed a dashboard with which they could manage information about their customers more easily.`, `Big and difficult part of this project was connecting the database (data received from customers) to their already functioning ERP system.`, `The platform cannot be opened by a non customer so a demo is not available, nor is the codebase.
