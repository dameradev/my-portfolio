**Still a work in progress, I am the main frontend developer,
the website is a demonstration/selling point for their product.
I implemented disby payment system, airtable to keep track of orders,
and DHL for shipping accross the world. The hardest part was by far implementing DHL and parsing/changing the
user input to make sure it fits their API format.**
